# roll-propose

## Gotchas

- Proposals go to .roll/proposals.md for review; never write them directly into BACKLOG.
- Keep product scenarios user-facing rather than turning every code smell into a feature proposal.

> Follows the Architecture Constraints, Development Discipline, and Engineering
> Common Sense defined in the project AGENTS.md.

Human-triggered skill for product-level feature ideation. Generates structured
User Story drafts from a product/user perspective and queues them in
.roll/proposals.md for human approval before entering BACKLOG.

## Distinct from roll-.dream

| | roll-propose | roll-.dream |
|---|---|---|
| Triggered by | Human explicitly | Nightly schedule |
| Perspective | User-facing / product scenarios | Code health / technical debt |
| Output | .roll/proposals.md (pending approval) | BACKLOG (REFACTOR-XXX) |
| Thinking style | "What would users want next?" | "What is the code telling us?" |

## When to Use

```
$roll-propose                   # generate proposals from full context
$roll-propose 用户反馈里提到了XX  # provide a focus hint
```

## When Not to Use

- Describing a known defect or broken behavior (use `$roll-idea`)
- A story is already well-defined and ready to build (use `$roll-build`)
- Exploring technical architecture or design (use `$roll-design`)
- Surfacing code-level technical debt (use `$roll-.dream`)

## Behavior

### Step 1 — Gather Context

Read in parallel:

1. `.roll/backlog.md` — all existing US-XXX, FIX-XXX, REFACTOR-XXX, IDEA-XXX entries (both Todo and Done) to avoid proposing duplicates
2. `.roll/proposals.md` (if exists) — already-proposed items (avoid re-proposing rejected or pending ones)
3. Recent 20 commits via `git log --oneline -20` — what has recently shipped
4. `skills/` directory listing — what capabilities roll already has
5. Optional: any focus hint passed by the user

### Step 2 — Think from User Perspective

Frame proposals from the **product engineer / end user** point of view:

- What recurring friction do users of roll face that no current skill addresses?
- What workflow is partially covered but has visible gaps?
- What would make the autonomous loop more legible, controllable, or trustworthy to its human owner?

Avoid technical-debt reasoning (that is roll-.dream's domain). Focus on:
- New user-visible commands or behaviors
- Improvements to existing UX (output clarity, discoverability, onboarding)
- Integrations that extend reach (new AI tools, editor support, CI patterns)

### Step 3 — Draft 1–3 Proposals

Generate between 1 and 3 proposals. For each:

```
## PROPOSAL: {Short title}
```

`{Short title}` 写法：用户看得懂的一句话，说清楚"加什么"或"解决什么问题"。不用技术术语，不提内部实现。这句话批准后会直接成为 BACKLOG 里的描述。

```
**Motivation (why):**
One to two sentences from the user's perspective explaining the pain or opportunity.

**Target scenario:**
Concrete usage example — what the user does, what they see, what they gain.

**Acceptance Criteria (draft):**
- [ ] AC 1
- [ ] AC 2
- [ ] AC 3

**Suggested ID:** US-{EPIC}-{NNN}  (best-guess prefix; human assigns final ID)
**Suggested Epic / Feature:** {name}
**Estimated complexity:** {S | M | L}
```

Complexity guide: S = one skill file or small bin/roll change, M = skill + bin/roll + tests, L = multi-file + new infrastructure.

### Step 4 — Write to .roll/proposals.md

Append to `.roll/proposals.md` in the project root (create if absent):

```markdown
---
proposed: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}
status: pending
---

{proposals from Step 3}
```

Use `---` as separator between proposal batches. Never overwrite existing content.

### Step 5 — Report

```
✅ roll-propose: {N} proposal(s) written to .roll/proposals.md

To approve: move the entry to .roll/backlog.md and assign a US-XXX ID.
To reject:  annotate with "Rejected: {reason}" to suppress future re-proposals.
```

## Output Rules

- Write proposals in the same language as the project's primary documentation (Chinese for this project).
- Never write directly to .roll/backlog.md — .roll/proposals.md is the staging area.
- If a similar proposal already exists in .roll/proposals.md (pending or rejected), note similarity and skip or merge rather than creating a duplicate.
- Aim for 2 proposals by default; generate 1 if context is thin, 3 if focus hint suggests a rich area.

## .roll/proposals.md Format

```markdown
# Roll Proposals

> 待审批提案。批准后手工移入 .roll/backlog.md 并分配 US-XXX 编号。
> 拒绝时在条目末尾注明拒绝原因，防止 Agent 重复提出相似提案。
